Halite Strategy Bot – Rule-Based AI Agent for Two Sigma's Halite Game
This repository contains a rule-based AI agent developed for Halite by Two Sigma – a competitive resource management game where players control fleets of ships to collect halite, build shipyards, and outmaneuver opponents.

The agent uses rule-based inferencing to make strategic decisions, relying on deterministic logic to optimize ship movement, halite collection, and shipyard placement. It emphasizes simplicity, clarity, and reliable performance across diverse match conditions.

Key Features:
- Rule-based movement and mining strategies

- Safe navigation and collision avoidance

- Shipyard creation logic based on board control

- Halite density mapping for optimal resource targeting

- Endgame return logic for maximum score optimization

The repository includes the full agent code, testing framework, and gameplay logs from various matches.
